<p>Project Title : Clogging Controler For ADHOC Networks.
Technology  : Java,Sql.
Role            : Team Leader.
Description: 
                          “ Clogging Control For Adhoc Network”, the project proposes a technique to transfer the data from one Hop to another Hop without congestion . The main aim of project is to control congestion in a wireless multihop networks.</p>

<p>Result           : The result of the project is to avoid conjestion over signals and to transfer data completely.</p>

The risks of not filtering spam are the constant flood of spam blocks networks and negatively impacts user inbox. </p>
